Freecam² - an Open Sourced FiveM Freecam Resource

# What is it?
Freecam² is an advanced Camera script that is used for creating screenshots in-game. Inspired by the Ingame Screenshot script by jedijosh920 and originally done by CamK06, Freecam² takes steps beyond what the original Freecam resource can do.

With Freecam², you can make cool screenshots like this!

Combine it with [PF-vMenu](https://github.com/ProjectFairnessLabs/PF-vMenu), and you already have a pretty killer setup. This is a must-have for your FiveM server, whether you're a PvP type person, or a car meet server.
